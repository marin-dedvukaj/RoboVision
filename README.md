# RoboVision
This is a python project that aims to create a library that take in images and identify tokens and such things so that they can be modified to make Ai powered simple vision for robots. It will mostly use pre existing libraries.  

## Requirements 
Python libraries:
```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
```

## How to run
After importing lbraries mentioned above this code can be run simply by executing mmain.py . This action will open the camera detect the tags and print their id. 
But this code is meant to be modified and used in conjuction with other code like the included red green detector or logic to make more complex programs.
